ex3_1.c will output 'Hello' twice,
because fork() is copying the address space
into the forked process, thus sharing the buffer
between the two processes.

The buffer won't be empty because the default
behaviour of the it is to flush either
on a line break or when the buffer is overflowed,
so inserting a \n in the ex3_2.c
gives the expected behaviour.
