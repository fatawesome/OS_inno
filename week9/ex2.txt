LOL that's ez one.

To increase hit rate and descreas miss rate just make as much
equal references in a row as possible.
To decrease hit rate and increase miss rate do the opposite.

Also the good idea is to make the interval between equal
references less than page frames we have. So algorithm will not
unload desired reference earlier than we need it.
